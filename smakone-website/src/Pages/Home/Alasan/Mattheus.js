            latterPar1 = "Mattheus Bryan Djahtranto is a senior highschooler in SMAK 1 BPK PENABUR Jakarta  who loves debating. He is currently the president of SMAK 1’s EDS (English Debating Society) and was officially the 9th best English high school debater across Indonesia in 2021. He has won 3 champion titles (ALSA E-comp UI 2021, KOMPEK FEB UI 2022 & SMAKERZ SEC 2022), 5 runner ups and 16 best speaker awards in several different national tournaments throughout his debating career so far."
            latterPar2 = "At first, Mattheus joined EDS simply because he thought he had decent English and public speaking skills, but as he pursued debating even further, he fell in love with it. He learned how to think critically, gained a lot of new friends and won multiple awards because of his decision to join EDS. It hasn’t always been easy for Mattheus either, there were nights when he had to stay up till 3 AM just for practice and there were times when he had to sacrifice hanging out with his friends during the weekends for a tournament. “Your efforts will pay off eventually” is what Mattheus has always told himself and it has helped him go through all of his struggles until he actually succeeded and became one of the best high school debaters in the country."
            latterPar3="Although he has participated in dozens of tournaments both nationally and internationally, the NSDC (National Schools Debating Championship) remains to be his most memorable one. Not just because it’s the most prestigious tournament in Indonesia, but also because he represented Jakarta in that tournament. The honor of representing one’s own province after going through a very competitive regional selection truly means a lot to Mattheus. Despite not being able to take the champion title, Mattheus and his team still managed to get second place and that meant being the second best highschool debating team across Indonesia. Merit aside, what mattered to Mattheus the most was the unforgettable experience that he and his teammates went through. The struggle of training together for 2 months straight, the joy of meeting debaters from different provinces and the thrill of coming up with ideas in such a short amount of time."
            latterPar4="Although Mattheus has won several awards throughout his career, he never could’ve done it had he not been in SMAK 1: the teachers, the seniors, the alumni, the competitive environment, and the school itself that facilitates its students with the best equipment. "
